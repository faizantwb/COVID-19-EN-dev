      - text: "Symptoms of COVID-19 are generally mild for most people, especially young people and healthy people. However in some cases, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the coronavirus could affect them and their loved ones. The most powerful thing we can do is to take actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. Firstly thorough hand-washing and following hygiene measures. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings.

      - text: "In difficult times children may respond in different ways. They may be scared or angry. They might show changes in their behaviour like wetting the bed, wanting to be closer to you or becoming quiet and withdrawn.   Respond to your child’s reactions in a supportive way, listen to their concerns and give them extra love and attention. Children need adults’ love and attention during difficult times. Listen to your children and speak kindly. As much as possible, make opportunities for the child to play and relax. Keep to regular routines and schedules as much as possible.   Try and keep children close to their parents and family. If separation occurs (for exmple someone has to go hospital) ensure regular contact (via phone) and make sure they feel safe and supported.   Give them facts about what has happened; explain what is going on now and give them clear information about how to reduce their risk of being infected by the disease in words that they can understand depending on their age. This also includes providing information about what could happen in a re-assuring way (e.g. a family member and/or the child may start not feeling well and may have to go to the hospital for some time so doctors can help them feel better)."

    utter_answer_covid_how_spread:
      - text: "People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick and to wash your hands regularly. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings."

    utter_answer_covid_infection_likelihood:

For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. "

This may vary under different conditions (for example, the type of surface, the temperature or the application of the environment).
